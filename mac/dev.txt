Heisenbug - disappear or alter its behaviour when one attempts to study it
Bohrbug - is a "good, solid bug". do not change their behaviour and are relatively easily detected.
Mandelbug - is a bug whose causes are so complex it defies repair, or makes its behaviour appear chaotic or even non-deterministic or bug that exhibits fractal behaviour by revealing more bugs
Schrödinbug - manifests itself in running software after a programmer notices that the code should never have worked in the first place
Hindenbug - is a bug with catastrophic behaviour
